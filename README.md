# Posterior-Decoding-and-Viterbi
Posterior decoding and Viterbi algorithms on Hidden Markov Models to detect C/G rich regions in a DNA sequence.

## Problem description
DNA sequences are made up of the nucleotides adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C), and thymine (T). In the genomes of organisms, these are not distributed randomly. Rather, some regions will have more A's and T's, while other regions will have more C's and G's. This is important to note because C/G rich regions tend to have more genes, while A/T rich regions have more non-functional DNA.

This program uses Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) to detect C/G rich regions. The program will use the Viterbi and Posterior algorithms.
